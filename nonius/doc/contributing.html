<p>Contributions to nonius are very welcome, whether by filing bugs, suggesting features, contributing code, or helping
with documentation. This page provides some info that might be helpful when doing so.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-bugs-and-suggesting-features">Reporting bugs and suggesting features</h3>

<p>If you find a bug in nonius, please open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/rmartinho/nonius/issues">issue tracker</a>. Provide as much detail as you can. Suggested
features also go on the issue tracker.</p>

<h3 id="building">Building</h3>

<p>To build the nonius single-header file, the examples, and the tests, you need to have a Python installation and the
<a href="https://ninja-build.org">ninja</a> build tool.</p>

<p>Start by running the boostrap script from the repository root:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> tools/bootstrap.py</code></pre></figure>

<p>This script accepts a few flags that you can checkout with <code>--help</code>.</p>

<p>After running the bootstrapper you can use ninja to perform build tasks.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="c"># generate the single-header file in dist/nonius.h++</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ninja header

<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="c"># build the documentation in dist/doc/ (this requires jekyll and pygments to be installed)</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ninja docs

<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="c"># build the examples in bin/examples/</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ninja examples

<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="c"># build the test runner in bin/test</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ninja <span class="nb">test</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Currently, if you create new files, ninja won’t know about them until the bootstrap script is re-run. You can force this
by simply <code>touch</code>ing the bootstrap script before running ninja. It will then pick up all the new files.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">$</span> touch tools/bootstrap.py
<span class="gp">$</span> ninja examples
<span class="go">[1/1] BOOTSTRAP</span>
<span class="go">[1/2] C++ examples/example6.c++</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="writing-code">Writing code</h3>

<p>Please try to keep coding style consistent throughout the repository.</p>

<p>All macros starts with <code>NONIUS_</code> for namespacing purposes, and everything else goes inside the <code>nonius</code> namespace.
Please hide implementation details in the <code>nonius::detail</code> namespace.</p>

<p>Nonius should work with GCC, clang, and Visual C++. The versions supported are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for GCC, the latest minor and patch of each of the last three major versions (as of August 12, 2016, that means
versions 4.9.4, 5.4, and 6.1 are supported);</li>
  <li>for clang, the latest patch of each of the last three minor versions, according to the LLVM project versioning scheme,
not according to Apple’s (as of August 12, 2016, that means versions 3.6.2, 3.7.1, and 3.8.1 are supported);</li>
  <li>for Visual C++ the latest minor and patch of each of the last three major versions, starting with Visual Studio 2015
(as of August 12, 2016, that means only the compiler—cl.exe, not the IDE—version 19.00.24213.1 is
supported);</li>
</ul>

<p>C++ feature use should be limited in such a way that all these versions are supported.</p>

<p>Currently nonius depends on Boost for some functionality. The versions of Boost that are supported are the latest
patches of each of the last three minor versions (as of August 12, 2016, that means versions 1.59.0, 1.60.0, and 1.61.0
are supported).</p>

<h4 id="branches-tags-releases">Branches, tags, releases</h4>

<p>If you want to contribute code, make a pull request against the <code>devel</code> branch in the <a href="https://github.com/rmartinho/nonius">main repository</a>. Once it has
been reviewed and approved it will be merged. The <code>devel</code> branch tracks all code that is pending for the next release.</p>

<p>Once properly tested on all supported platforms, the <code>devel</code> branch is merged into the <code>stable</code> branch, tagged with a
release number, and a new release entry is added on GitHub.</p>

<h4 id="writing-documentation">Writing documentation</h4>

<p>Documentation is kept in the <code>doc/</code> folder, in the form of a Jekyll website.</p>

<p>All interfaces intended for public consumption should be described in the documentation. Currently there is no
reference-style documentation as the number of interfaces exposed is low; descriptive prose is preferred.</p>

<p>Pull requests that introduce new features will not be merged until the documentation is written. This ensures that on
every merge to the <code>devel</code> branch, the documentation in the repo reflects the current state of the code.</p>

<p>Documentation is automatically picked up every day and served at nonius.io.</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation for the latest release is served from <a href="https://nonius.io/">https://nonius.io/</a>;</li>
  <li>documentation for older releases are served from https://nonius.io/vM.m/, where <code>M</code> is the major number and <code>m</code> is the minor number (e.g.
<a href="https://nonius.io/v1.1/">https://nonius.io/v1.1/</a>);</li>
  <li>documentation for the latest <code>devel</code> branch is served from <a href="https://nonius.io/devel/">https://nonius.io/devel/</a>;</li>
</ul>
